The basename command is used to extract the base name of a file path, which is essentially the filename without the directory path. The basic syntax is as follows:

The dirname command extracts the directory portion of a file path, excluding the filename itself.

#!/bin/bash

file_path="/path/to/myfile.txt"

# Without basename
echo "Full file path: $file_path"

# With basename
filename=$(basename "$file_path")
echo "Filename: $filename"
